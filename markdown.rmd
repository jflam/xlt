title: "Airports in the United States"
---

Let's load a list of airport data from https://github.com/jpatokal/openflights

```{r}
airports <- read.csv("airports.dat", header = FALSE)
colnames(airports) <- c("ID", "name", "city", "country", "IATA_FAA", "ICAO", "lat", "lon", "altitude", "timezone", "DST", "Region")

```

This data set contains airports from all over the world. Let's get only the 
airports from the United States.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

library(dplyr)
usa_airports <- airports %>% filter(country == "United States")

library(DT)
datatable(usa_airports[,c("name", "city", "country", "IATA_FAA", "lat", "lon", "altitude")])
```

Let's generate a static map containing the location of all of the airports in the USA

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ggmap)
map <- get_map(location = "Seattle, WA", zoom = 3)
ggmap(map) + geom_point(aes(x = lon, y = lat), data = usa_airports, alpha = 0.25)
```

Let's generate a zoomable, pannable map using the leaflet package. Here you can
see airports that belong to the USA that aren't geographically within the borders
of the United States.

```{r}
library(leaflet)
m <- leaflet(data = usa_airports) %>%
  addTiles() %>%  # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles
  addCircles(~lon, ~lat, popup = ~name)
m  # Print the map
```
